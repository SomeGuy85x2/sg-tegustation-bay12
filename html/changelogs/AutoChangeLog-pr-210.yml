changes:
  - tweak: You can now see if a drink contains ice or is completely ice when examining
      it while close by.
  - tweak: Water no longer makes a sound or plays a message when freezing, and ice
      no longer makes a sound or plays a message when melting.
  - bugfix: Because of the above, water bottles will no longer invade your ears or
      your chat when opening/closing freezers containing them.
